# AE370Project2
This project models the dynamic interaction between a train pantograph and an electrified catenary wire using numerical methods. We aim to determine how key factors â€” including train speed, wire tension, damping, and thermal effects, influence critical speed, contact stability, and overall system performance in high-speed rail systems.
